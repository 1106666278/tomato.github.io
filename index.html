            <h2>About Snake VS Block</h2>
            <p>
                Snake VS Block is a fun and challenging mobile-style arcade game. The objective is to guide your snake, made of balls, through blocks that have numbers on them. Each number represents the number of segments your snake needs to have to break through the block. When you hit a block, you lose segments equal to the number on the block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collect white balls scattered across the path to increase the length of your snake. The longer your snake, the more blocks you can break, especially those with higher numbers. The game ends when your snake runs out of segments. Try to go as far as possible and achieve the highest score!
            </p>
            <p>
                With simple swipe controls and engaging gameplay, Snake VS Block is easy to pick up but hard to put down. Perfect for quick gaming sessions.
